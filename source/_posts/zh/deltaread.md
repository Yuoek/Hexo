It's good to be smart. After all, intelligent people earn more money, aaccumulate more wealth, and even live longer. But there's another sidle to the story. The brightest people and strongest leaders sometimesmake errors others don't, especially in situations that require common sense.
Travis Bradberry, president at TalentSmart, explained in his post Why Smarple Act So Stupid that "Rational thinking and intelligence don't tend to gn hand. Intelligent people are more prone to silly mistakes because of bliin how they use logic. These blind spots exist because smart people tend t
overconfident in their reasoning abilities." They are so used to beingright and having quick answers that they don't even realize when they're making a mess by answering without thinking things through
A life time of praise leads smart people to develop too much faith intheir intelligence and abilities. They often fail to recognize when theyy need help, and when they do recognize it, they tend to believe thatno one else is capable of providing it
"It's hard to anyone to graciously accept the fact that they're wyrong. It's even harder for smart people because they grow so used to being right all the time that it becomes a part of their identity," Bradberry wrote. "For smart people, being wrong canfeel like a personal attack, and being right, a necessity."
Smart people also have a hard time accepting feedback. They tend toundervalue the opinions of others, which means they have trouble believing that anyone is qualified to give them useful feedback. Not only does this tendency hinder their growth and performance, it can leaad to harmful relationships, both personally and
professionally.
Smart people develop overachieving personalities because things comhe so easily to them. They simply don't understand how hard some peeople have to work to accomplish the same things, and because of that, they push people too hard. They set the bar too high, and when people take too long or don't get things quite right, they
assume it's due to a lack of effort. So they push even harder.

## 2_Competitive Rivals Can Make You More Successful

Having a rival can keep you committed to achieving your goals and enhance your overall performance. But before you go out and find anentrepreneur to outcompete, it's important to understand and avoid the traps that often come with rivalry. After all, competitive rivalry carn also hinder effective decision-making and increase your
willingness to take risks, behaviors that can ultimately hurt your venture's success.
Finding someone you're committed to outcompeting can be a great way to stay focused on your goals and push your venture to the next leevel. But when you're intently focused on outperforming your rivals, you may begin to develop a"win-at-all-costs"mentality that causes youto ignore how you achieve success. One group of
researchers, for example, examined the link between rivalry and unethical behavior. They found that when people compete against their rivvals, they are more willing to behave unethically to win. But such behavior may stain your reputation and strain relationships important toyour success. One way to avoid this trap is to stop and
reflect on what's important. While outperforming your rivals may providle short-term benefits, the loss of your integrity will have long-term consequences
One reason having a rival can enhance your venture's performance isthat it creates a level of excitement that drives you to work harder. EBut this eagerness to win may also hurt your venture's success, particularly when it causes you to make impulsive, insensible decisions. Buttit's possible to avoid such costly mistakes by making a
habit of engaging in critical thinking, such as considering opposing viewpoints and conducting cost-benefit analyses, especially for those deecisions that are complex and can determine the future of your venturre.
The sense of eagerness that comes with having a rival can not only cause you to make poorer decisions, but it can also lead you to take greater riskat put your venture in peril. One way you can overcome the risk-inducing eeffects of rivalry that stand to endanger your venture's success is to remattentive to your emotional state
and actively monitor how such feelings are affecting your decision-making.

《Should University Libraries be Open to the Public?》

In recent times, the question of university library access for the public has led to intense debate. I believe they should be open, yet with some constraints.

On the plus side, opening them offers great benefits. University libraries are filled with vast book collections and diverse academic resources. Sharing these can drive knowledge spread and enhance society's cultural level. The public might get access to rare materials they couldn't reach otherwise.

However, potential issues can't be neglected. A large number of outside visitors can cause overcrowding and noise, disturbing students' study. To solve this, universities can adopt a reservation system or limit the number of non - university affiliated visitors during peak study periods.

In summary, although there are challenges in opening university libraries to the public, the advantages are far more significant. With appropriate management, a balance can be achieved between serving the public and safeguarding an excellent study environment for students.

《大学图书馆应该对公众开放吗？》

近来，关于大学图书馆是否应对公众开放的问题引发了激烈的讨论。我认为大学图书馆应该向公众开放，但需有一些限制条件。

从积极的方面来看，向公众开放大学图书馆有诸多益处。大学图书馆藏书丰富，学术资源多样。共享这些资源可以推动知识的传播，提高社会的文化水平。公众也可能因此获得原本无法接触到的珍稀资料。

然而，潜在的问题也不容忽视。大量的外来访客可能会导致图书馆过度拥挤和嘈杂，干扰学生学习。为解决这一问题，大学可以采用预约制度，或在学习高峰期限制非本校人员的访问数量。

总之，尽管向公众开放大学图书馆存在一些挑战，但好处更为显著。通过适当的管理，可以在为公众服务和为学生维护良好学习环境之间取得平衡。

已知一个存储器芯片M的4位二进制地址编码为A3A2A1A0，其8条数据线为D7D6D5D4D3D2D1D0，回答下列问题。
(1)该存储器共有多少个存储单元？
(2)如果需要构造256个存储单元且每个存储单元的字长为16位的存储器，则总计需要M芯片多少个？
(3)如果需要构造64个存储单元且每个存储单元的字长为16位的存储器，该存储器的6位二进制地址编码线为B5B4B3B2B1B0，16条数据线为E15~E0，请给出用M芯片构造64×2B存储器的方案。

(1) 存储器芯片$M$的$4$位二进制地址编码为$A_{3}A_{2}A_{1}A_{0}$，所以该存储器的存储单元个数为：

$2^{4}= 16$（个）


(2) 要构造$256$个存储单元且每个存储单元的字长为$16$位的存储器，总容量为：


$256\times16 = 4096$（位）

存储器芯片$M$的容量为：

$16\times8 = 128$（位）

则需要的$M$芯片个数为：

$4096\div128 = 32$（个）


(3) 要构造$64$个存储单元且每个存储单元的字长为$16$位的存储器，总容量为：

$64\times16 = 1024$（位）

存储器芯片$M$的容量为$16\times8 = 128$（位）

则需要的$M$芯片个数为：

$1024\div128 = 8$（个）

用$M$芯片构造$64\times2B$存储器的方案如下：

将$6$位二进制地址编码线$B_{5}B_{4}B_{3}B_{2}B_{1}B_{0}$分为两部分，高$3$位$B_{5}B_{4}B_{3}$用于片选，低$3$位$B_{2}B_{1}B_{0}$用于片内地址。

$8$个$M$芯片，需要$3$位地址进行片选，$2^{3}= 8$，可以分别对应$8$个芯片。

对于每个芯片，其$4$位地址线$A_{3}A_{2}A_{1}A_{0}$与$B_{2}B_{1}B_{0}$相连，作为片内地址。

$16$条数据线$E_{15}\sim E_{0}$，每$8$位与一个$M$芯片的$8$条数据线$D_{7}D_{6}D_{5}D_{4}D_{3}D_{2}D_{1}D_{0}$相连。

这样，通过片选信号和片内地址，就可以实现对$64$个存储单元且每个存储单元的字长为$16$位的存储器的构造。
